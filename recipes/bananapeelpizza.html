<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Prepare to challenge pizza norms with this unconventional creation. Start with a classic pizza crust and spread a layer of tomato sauce. Then, sprinkle a generous amount of shredded cheese on top. But here's the twist: instead of traditional toppings, arrange banana peels on the pizza in a visually striking pattern. Bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted.
